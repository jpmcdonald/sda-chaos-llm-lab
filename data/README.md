# Data

Dataset storage and preprocessing.

## Structure

- `raw/` - Original datasets (gitignored)
- `processed/` - Preprocessed datasets (gitignored)
- `scripts/` - Data preprocessing scripts

## Datasets

This lab focuses on small, reproducible datasets suitable for local training:
- Math/logic reasoning (GSM8K subsets)
- Chain-of-thought tasks
- Simple specification tasks

## Notes

- Raw and processed data are gitignored to keep the repo lightweight
- Include preprocessing scripts to enable reproducibility
- Document data sources and licenses
